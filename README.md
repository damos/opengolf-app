# Open Golf GPS
Simple open source golf GPS app. Users can create their own course definitions and Free Roam mode allows users to use the app without having a course defined.

Currently supports a VERY limited golf course database of courses I personally play regularly. A future vision for this app would be to collect the courses users have defined and create a large aggregate database.

App is available here (US and Canada only): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.dait.opengolf.app
