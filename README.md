# Open Golf GPS
Simple Open Source golf GPS app. Allows users to create their own course definitions and Free Roam allows users to use the app without having a course defined.

Currently supports a VERY limited golf course database of courses I personally play regularly. A future vision for this app would be to the courses users have defined and create a large aggregate database.

App is available here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.dait.opengolf.app
